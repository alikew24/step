        <p>
          My senior year of highschool, I made a 
          terminal based Connect Four game in Ruby. The user plays against a computer 
          AI who tries to win! Check out my code on<a href="https://github.com/alikew24/ConnectFour"> Github</a>.

        <h2>Cornell Clubs and Organizations</h2>
        <img class="project-image" src="images/clubs.png"/>
        <p>
          My sophomore spring of college, I built a website that stored information about
          various clubs at Cornell in a sqlite database, and had a gallery of images. Users could search
          for a specific club, add a club to the table, add an image, delete an image, or add and delete tags. All of 
          the work for this website was done in a class I took- Intermediate Design and Programming for the Web.

          on Heroku.

          My senior year of high school I created a terminal based Tic-Tac-Toe game in Ruby.
          The user plays against a computer AI who strategically picks the next best move. Check

        <h2>Java Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Freshman year of college I took a course in object oriented programming and 
          data structures. In this class, I coded a lot of projects in java that taught me about various
          data structures and programming efficiently. I also learned about Big O Notation.
